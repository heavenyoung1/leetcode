Russia said it test fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile,
 a move President Vladimir Putin said would give the U.S. and its 
allies something to think about.

It almost certainly ups the ante almost two months since Russia 
invaded Ukraine and it comes at a delicate moment in the conflict 
as its forces step up their offensive in the eastern Donbas region.

The Russian leader was shown on state television watching a video 
of the missile launch and remarked that “this unique weapon will 
strengthen the military potential of our armed forces, will reliably 
guarantee Russia’s security against outside threats and force those, 
who in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric try to threaten our 
country, to think again.”
